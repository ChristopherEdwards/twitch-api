EVENTS API REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

TwitchClient provides DOM-level events for handling communications from the
Twitch servers. To listen for a specific event (user joins a channel, for
example), use something akin to the following:
  document.addEventListener("twitch-join", function(event) {
    /* JOIN-specific logic here */
  });

These events are instances of either the TwitchEvent or TwitchChatEvent
classes. TwitchChatEvent inherits TwitchEvent. In addition to implementing the
DOM-level Event API (by inheriting from Event), these classes provide the
following extra APIs:

TwitchEvent:
  Attributes:
    command: the uppercase command that triggered this event
    raw_line: the raw IRC line
    values: an Object containing the information parsed from the raw line
  Methods:
    value(key): this.values[key]

  Per-command attributes (may not be available for all commands):
    channel: a channel object representing the channel the command was sent to
    message: a string with the line's message
    user: the raw username for the user who sent/received this line
    name: the formatted username for the user who sent/received this line
    flags: the extra data associated with this line
  Per-command methods (may not be available for all commands):
    flag(key): this.flags[key]

TwitchChatEvent:
  Attributes:
    id: a value that uniquely identifies this specific chat message
    ismod: true if the message was sent by a moderator
    issub: true if the message was sent by a subscriber
    isvip: true if the message was sent by a VIP
  Methods:
    has_badge(badge_name, [badge_rev]): true if the message has the badge
      specified, optionally limiting to a specific badge revision number

A "Channel Object" is an Object of the following format:
  {channel: "#channel-name",
   room: "room name" or undefined,
   roomuid: UUID uniquely identifying this room, or undefined}
All "channel" attributes below refer to channel objects.

The following events are available:
  twitch-ping
  twitch-ack
  twitch-topic
  twitch-names
  twitch-join
